# Teaching myself computer science

This repo is a recompilation notes on books and courses. When needed, it'll
probably contain links to other repositories for specific projects related to
courses, but I'll try to keep it all here.

This repository is organized to reflect my learning path, including notes from
courses, books, projects, and practice problems.

Also, as a disclaimer of sorts, I think there are three types of learning:
formal learning, non-formal learning and informal learning.

This repo is for the second type: non-formal. As such, it doesn't include notes
on things I learn day-to-day on the job or other types of personal projects.
Also it doesn't include notes on my Civil Engineering clases at UTN FRP nor
Software Engineering classes at UNL FICH.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a centralized place for all my notes, code, and
resources as I progress through various computer science topics. It is inspired
by the curriculum from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), and
it includes additional materials and practice exercises.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### core_subjects

Contains notes and materials for each core subject in the curriculum.

```
core_subjects/
├── programming/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── computer_architecture/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── algorithms_and_data_structures/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── mathematics_for_cs/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── operating_systems/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── computer_networking/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── databases/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
├── languages_and_compilers/
│   ├── book/
│   └── course/
└── distributed_systems/
    ├── book/
    └── course/
```

- **Each subject** has its own directory with two subdirectories:
  - `book/`: Contains notes, summaries, and insights from textbooks or readings.
  - `course/`: Contains lecture notes, assignments, and related materials from
    courses.

### projects

Contains all project work, including code and documentation.

- **Projects** may include:
  - Implementations of concepts learned.
  - Larger-scale applications or systems.
  - Documentation (`docs/`), source code (`src/`), and other relevant files.

### additional_resources

Contains supplementary materials, practice problems, tools, and useful websites.

```
additional_resources/
├── books/
├── courses/
├── practice/
│   └── leetcode/
│       ├── easy/
│       ├── medium/
│       ├── hard/
│       └── topics/
├── tools/
└── websites/
```

## How to Use This Repository

- **Navigating Notes**:
  - Go to `core_subjects/` and select the subject you're interested in.
  - Inside each subject, choose `book/` for textbook notes or `course` for
    course materials.
- **Viewing Projects**:
  - Visit the `projects/` directory to explore practical applications and code.
    In some cases, the repo is going to link another repo.
- **Exploring Additional Resources**:
  - Check out `additional_resources/` for supplementary materials.
    - **books/**: Find notes from extra books you're reading.
    - **courses/**: Access materials from additional courses.
    - **practice/**: Engage with practice problems, especially from LeetCode.
      - Problems are categorized by difficulty and topic for targeted practice.
